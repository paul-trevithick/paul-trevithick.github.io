    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      I am pretty flexible, I simply want to gain skill in a field I am
      interested in. Where I can apply those skill remains to be seen, but tech
      or tech ajacent would be ideal.
    </p>
    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h3>
    <p>
      I believe I am quick to grasp new concepts and gain a good understanding.
      Recalling those is another matter, I realise thing dont stick unless I
      have done them several times I need to stop being so shy, ask for help,
      reach out early and often. Stop doubting myself.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Soooo many. be better organised, stick to my plans, interact with people a
      lot more, STOP PROCRASTINATING!!
    </p>
    <h3>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I need to start when I say I will, stop letting my own nervousness inhibit
      my learning, set targets and stick to them. Being respectful and listening
      activly without being distracted will lead to more productive interactions
      over discord and zoom. Face to face interactions will be very minimal.
      When things get overwhelming I take a break, get a drink, get out a pen
      and paper and try to list the roadblocks or issues I am facing.
    </p>
    <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
    <p>
      Stop being a big chicken! Just ask. Limit the time I spend trying to solve
      the issue myself and googling answers. If I dont find it quck, just reach
      out!
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I expect facilitators will be there to provide solutions and guidance, to
      be able to leverage their knowledge to enable my own learning and solution
      finding. Their hours of support will be limited. An icecream cake on my
      birthday1

    <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Between 5pm and around 10pm will be dinner time/catch up time. There may
      be occasional kid pick ups or appointments, but they are usually short
      notice and dont take up alot of time. I need to commit to starting earlier
      in the day when help is available and not working so late into the night

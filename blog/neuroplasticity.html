    <h2 class="centre">Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <h4>How does understanding neuroplasticity benefit us?</h4>
    <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity can have many benefitsfor individuals in various aspects of life. 
      Neuroplasticity refers to the brains ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. It is the ability to change and re-wire
      itself and is the basis of learning and repair after injury.</p>
      <p>By understanding how neuroplasticity works, 
        individuals can adopt strategies to improve their cognitive abilities, such as engaging 
        in new learning activities and practicing skills.</p>
        <p>Benefits of neuroplasticity can include:
          <ul>
            <li>Enhanced learning and memory: know that he brain can adapt and is always changing, sustained and repetitive activity 
              leads to stronger and new neural pathways "practice makes permanent".</li>
              <li>Recovery from Brain Injuries: The brain can rewire itself to compensate for 
                damaged areas, allowing other parts of the brain to take over functions that were lost.</li>
                <li>Mental Health and Emotional Resilience: understanding leverages the principles of neuroplasticity to help individuals change negative thought patterns and behaviors.</li>
                <li>Adaptability and Flexibility: By embracing new experiences and stepping out of comfort zones, 
                  individuals can enhance their brains flexibility and ability to handle change</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

          but also know that with practice it will be easier and I can only become more proficient by doing!</P>
          <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
          <p><ul>
            <li>
              Learn a New Skill - like coding duh</li>
              <li>Mindfulness and Meditation</li>

      <h3 class="centre">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional intelligence (EQ or EI) is the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you.
          Having a high EI means you are able to realise how you are feeling, what those feelings mean and how those feelings will affect you and your behaviour.
          It also means you can identify the emotions behind other peoples behaviour in order to better understand them and know better how to interact with them. Operating with empathy and understanding is a critical part of teamwork
          There are 5 key elements to emotional inteligence:
          <ol>
            <li>Self-awareness</li>
            <li>Self-regulation</li>
            <li>motivation</li>
            <li>Empathy</li>
            <li>Social skills</li>
          </ol>
          EI is a skill and can be trained:
          <ul>
            <li>Try to slow down you instictive emotional response, embrace that emotion before acting on it. Ask yourself why you feel that way. If the reaction was caused by another person, ask yourself "what was the emotion behind their behaviour?"</li>
            <li>Think about your strengths and weaknesses. No one is good at everything, and that’s okay! Know yourself and when to ask for - or offer - help.</li>
            <li>Put in an effort to understand what other people are communicating, recognise people may be feeling overwhelmed or form a different background and have a different understanding to your own</li>
            <li>Work on communicating effectively and openly. Make sure your main point is clear, cut out information that isn’t relevant to the person you’re talking with, and give your full attention when someone else is speaking. Employ concious listening</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      <h3 class="centre">How is EQ different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>
          Your EQ refers to your emotional abilities and social skills, 
          including cognitive empathy, emotional regulation, and motivation. It is the ability to identify emotions in youself and others, to empathise with others and adapt your own feelings and behaviour depending on the situation. 
          It's how you control yourimpulses andcommunicate with others.</p>

          <p> Conversely, IQ measures your cognitive and intellectual skills, 
            like working memory, analytical thinking, and knowledge retention

          </p>
      <h3 class="centre">Why is EQ important?</h3>
      <p>
        Having a high level of emotional intelligence allows you to empathize with others, communicate effectively, and be both self and socially aware. It helps you understand yourself more fully, your own behaviours and how they effect those around you.
        It enables us to work well with others and to actively listen, to avoid confrontation and provide motivation, meaning you are less likely to feel stressed

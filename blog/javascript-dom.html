      How to describe Javascript and its relationship with HTL and CSS?
    </h3>
    <p class="p">
      HTML creates and structures the website's content, CSS adds style and
      formatting to these structures, and then JavaScript turns those stylized
      components into something that a user can interact with. A good way to
      think of it is to compare the creation of a web site to building a house.
      HTML is the blue print and structure, the walls , the foundation, the
      rooms and what you want in them. CSS is the styling or interior
      decoration. Paint colours, furniture style and placement, even the type of
      art to put on the walls! JavaScript is how we interact with everything,
      the light switches, heating and cooling and running the appliances.
    </p>

    <h3 class="centre">Control flow and Loops</h3>

    <p class="p">
      Control flow refers to the order in which statements or functions are
      executed in a program. Loops are used to repeat a set of instructions
      (code) until a certain parameter is met. An example of these in everyday
      life could be baking a cake. You follow a recipe in order with sequential
      steps: pre-heat the oven, prepare ingredients, mix ingredients, place mix
      in dish, place dish in the oven, cook til done, remove from oven and let
      cool.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      A conditional step would be whether you have all the ingredients available
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      An example of a loop in this process would be checking the temperature or
      how cooked the cake is periodically until the cake is cooked through.
    </p>

    <h3 class="centre">
      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h3>

    <p class="p">
      The DOM stands for document object model. It is the data representation of
      all the objects that make up the structure and content of w a web page.
      While not a programming language itself it is a web API (Application
      Programming Interfaceused) to build websites, it is platform an language
      neutral. This means that the DOM allows us to dynamically manipulate the
      style, content and structure of a document.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      The DOM represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where
      each object corresponds to a part of the document, such as an element,
      attribute, or text.
    </p>

    <h4 class="centre">Example of the DOM tree</h4>

    <p class="p">
      We can make changes through the DOM and JavaScript to a website. Say for
      example we notice a spelling mistake in some text.
    </p>

    <img class="centre-img2" src="exarmple.png" alt="A spelling mistake" />
    <h4 class="centre">Some basic HTML</h4>

    <p class="p">
      We can access that line of code with javascript by referencing the Id of
      that paragraph and inserting the correct text, for example:
      <strong
        >document.getElementById('test').innerHTML = "This is an
        example"</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      We access the docment an addres a specific section by its ID (test), then
      we can replace the text inside the 'p' tags with the command .innerHTML
    </p>
    <h3 class="centre">
      The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
    </h3>

    <p class="p">
      Arrays are ordered collections of elements of the same type e.g names
      ['Mark', 'Juice', 'Freckle', 'Squirrly Dan'] or numbers ['34', '98', '3',
      '55']. An item in an array is accessed by its index, which starts at 0. So
      four items will be indexed as 0,1,2,3. The fourth item will be index
      number 3, enjoy!
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Objects are collections of key-value pairs and are used when grouping
      multiple sets of data that belong together
    </p>

    <img class="centre-img2" src="objects.png" alt="Simple object JS" />

    <h4 class="centre">Object example</h4>

    <p class="p">
      In this example the key is the 'name' and the value is 'Sport'
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      Objects are ideal for storing data with corresponding properties (keys),
      someones personal details for example.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
      In summary, arrays are great for ordered lists, while objects are perfect
      for key-value pairs where you need to label each piece of data.
    </p>

    <h3 class="centre">What are functions and why they are helpful?</h3>
    <p class="p">
      A javascript function is a block of code designed to complete a particular
      task when called (activated). This code is versatile and can be applied
      over and over and used in other fuctions or assigned to other variables,
      this allows for less complex code to be required.

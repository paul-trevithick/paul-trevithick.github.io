      <H1>Identity Values</H1>
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
        <p>I can't say I have ever been in a situation where a major ethical dilemma has ever occured. I've never been in charge of the trolley,  so to speak.
        whenever i find myself in a situation that may be considered an ethical decision, I simply try to ask myself "how would I like to be treated".
        Which makes the answer easy. If I get under charged at the checkout, just point it out. Get praised for work I didn't do, make sure that praise is directed to the right person.
        I have found putting these typre of situations through a personal lense can drastically and simply influence your decisions for the better.

      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My family's way of showing affection has always been to take the piss, we have always been slow to give encouragment and don't show a lot of affection.
          This has changed when the latest generation came about, my neices and nephews really shone the light on the ways in which my immediate family interacted.
          While I was always raised to be polite, kind and considerate, showing affection and giving support openly just were never the default setting.
          I am glad that, whether concious or not, initially, that state of being has evolved massivly in the past 8 years. The "I love you" and cuddles are the norm now. Yay!

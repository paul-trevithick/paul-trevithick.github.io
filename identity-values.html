      <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
        <p>I can't say I have ever been in a situation where a major ethical dilemma has ever occured. I've never been in charge of the trolley,  so to speak.
        whenever i find myself in a situation that may be considered an ethical decision, I simply try to ask myself "how would I like to be treated".
        Which makes the answer easy. If I get under charged at the checkout, just point it out. Get praised for work I didn't do, make sure that praise is directed to the right person.
        I have found putting these typre of situations through a personal lense can drastically and simply influence your decisions for the better.

      <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My family's way of showing affection has always been to take the piss, we have always been slow to give encouragment and don't show a lot of affection.
          This has changed when the latest generation came about, my neices and nephews really shone the light on the ways in which my immediate family interacted.
          While I was always raised to be polite, kind and considerate, showing affection and giving support openly just were never the default setting.
          I am glad that, whether concious or not, initially, that state of being has evolved massivly in the past 8 years. The "I love you" and cuddles are the norm now. Yay!

        <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
        <p>hmmmm, this is hard. Humour I guess and being a kind person, trying my best at least. To be completly honest I have dug myself a huge hole since being unemployed and undertaking this course is a tep to digging my way out
          I am pretty laid back and try to look for the positive/funny side of things, I'm hoping this will let me not become too overwhelmed when things are difficult and I lose my way.
        </p>
        <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
        <p>Technically there aren't any, right? Realistically, I've never been a proper student, I have never taught myself how to study and learn properly, it has also been a long time since I have been in that sort of environment.
          I procrastinate and stew in my own anxiety until the last minute and end up rushing at the last minute to finish things off. I need a clear path/design in my head before I commit to action, which isn't pratical for the way this course is taught.

        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p>I used to work in a team of three, on a rotating shift to cover 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.
          We required 2 people minimum per shift to keep prodution running, so if people were away we would cover for four hours either side of our shift depending on which was required.
          I was covering for someone, working on after my own shift. My team leader at the time encouraged collaboration, if you saw something that needed doing, you should do it. He hated the "that's not my job" mentality.
          So, while working on the mezzanine floor, I noticed a tank was running empty and required filling to complete the discharge process. So I filled it and completed the paperwork when returning to the main deck, saving the other operato a trip up two flights of stairs. Pretty standard practice on my own shift.
        When the operator who I was working with returned and saw that I had done said task, he confronted me, aggresively. I truly believed his outrage was faked and he was winding me up, the reaction was way over the top, so I laughed uncomfortably.
      Which was a big mistake, there was a lot of swearing! Long story short, I bit my tongue finished out the shift and escalated the incident to managment.
    In hindsight, I could have simply asked his expectations at the start of the shift, it was his shift to run (however badly) and I should not have made assumptions.      </p>
